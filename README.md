Restored from 30 year old Sony Video-8 deck with ESP32.
Communication via serial port.

The wheel has 5 pin connector, from left

1: +3.4 V

2: GND

3: pin YEL in jogwheel.py

4: pin GRE in jogwheel.py

5: pin ORA in jogwheel.py

"Portista" turns esp32 serial port signals into Cinelerra-keystrokes.

"Kaynnistys" also resassigns number-pad into start-end-cut-paste-pad:

"/" = start

"-" = end

"*" = cut

"9" = paste 

"Youtube" seems to be aimed for Youtube edit?

"jogwheel_gem.py" Gemini-version with Anglified variable names and fancy architecture. Not tested.
